    <h3>Using primitive travesty methods from the 1970s, <b>Fit To Fake</b> takes stories from today's headlines and mashes them into new stories.</h3>

    <p>Pick a section of todays news, or bits of historical documents, and digest them into the dictionary that drives the travesty synthesis. You'll get a list of story summaries that you can individually pick to add to the dictionary. Tap on the story to generate a new one. The generator limits itself to 150 words.<br>
    Here are the buttons' functions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>FORGET: clears the dictionary.</li>

      <li>ALL: selects all the stories and adds them to the dictionary.</li>

      <li>SPEAK: reads the stories after they are generated. A long press on the SPEAK button toggles RADIO mode, which generates a new travesty a half second after the previous one has stopped speaking.</li>

      <li>SHARE:text copies the travesty and calls up the document sharing interface so you can post it or paste it into another app.</li>

      <li>SHARE: png: shares the text as an image, for posting on social services that limit the number of characters.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>History</b><br>
    I've been writing travesty generators on this algorithm for decades. In fact, whenever I'd get access to a new operating system or computer language, I used to write this or a variant of it as my equivalent of "Hello World". The most interesting and productive variant has been my Amiga app "Sound Bite", which performed travesties on audio.<br>
    FitToFake was originally written as the response to a job interview programming test. I didn't get the job.</p>
