The Times, they are a changin' And to, you might like to be changin' the Times. This little project takes some text from the NY Times API, digests it, and generates new text based on the original stuff. It's uses a travesty method I've been using for more than 40 years.

You can clear out  it's grammar and vocabulary withthe FORGET button.

You can enable and disable speaking hte text becasue, who wants to read it anyway?

You can share that text via the Document interaction controller both as a text attachmnet (meh) or as a jpg.


This was a super-fast project, and I don't even really know Swift that well - you can probably tell.
