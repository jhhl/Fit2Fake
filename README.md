The Times, they are a changin'! And so, you might like to be changin' the Times. 

This little project takes some news summaries from the NY Times API, lets you select them, and generates new text based on the original stories. It uses a travesty method I've been using for more than 40 years.

Make new stories with the current vocabulary using the *FAKE IT* button.

You can clear out  its grammar and vocabulary with the *FORGET* button.

You can enable and disable speaking the text (*SPEAK/STOP*) because, who wants to read it anyway? New fake news starts speaking immediately after you choose a summary or tap the *FAKE IT* button. 

You can share that text with the *SHARE:text* button, or as a jpg with the *SHARE:Pic* button. I should probably make an animated gif or something.

Should you be stuck without Wi-Fi, and no connection to the Times servers, I throw in a few fake-news related tweets for you to work with as a kind of Easter Egg. 

This was a super-fast coded project, and I don't even really know Swift that well - as you can probably tell.
