The Times, they are a changin' And to, you might like to be changin
 the times. This little project takes some text from the NY Times API, digests it, and generates new text based on the original stuff.
  
In theory, it lets you share that text via the Document interaction controller, but it doesn't seem to work, really.

This was a super-fast project, and I don't even really know Swift that well - you can probably tell.
